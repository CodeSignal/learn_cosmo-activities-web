Fill in the blanks with the correct mathematical expressions

> **Problem 1:** The quadratic formula states that for an equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. This formula is used to find the roots of a [[blank:quadratic equation]].

> **Problem 2:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $c$ is the length of the [[blank:hypotenuse]].

> **Problem 3:** The derivative of $f(x) = x^n$ is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$. This is known as the [[blank:power rule]].

> **Problem 4:** The integral $\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$ (for $n \neq -1$) represents the [[blank:antiderivative]] of $x^n$.

> **Problem 5:** The limit $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$ is a fundamental result in [[blank:calculus]].

> **Problem 6:** The formula for the area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ represents the [[blank:radius]].

> **Problem 7:** Euler's identity $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ connects five fundamental mathematical constants: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and [[blank:0]].

> **Problem 8:** The sum of the first $n$ natural numbers is given by $S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. This formula was discovered by [[blank:Gauss]].
